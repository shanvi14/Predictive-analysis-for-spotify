# Predictive-analysis-for-spotify
Overview:
This project aims to accurately predict song popularity on Spotify by leveraging a comprehensive set of audio features. Additionally, we delve into understanding how user behavior attributes, including age, gender, usage period, etc., influence song choices. The project involves identifying the most effective predictive models for song popularity, assessing accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve), and providing valuable insights into user behavior and preferences on Spotify through visualizations and data-driven analysis.

Key Objectives:
Song Popularity Prediction:

Develop robust predictive models using audio features to forecast the popularity of songs on Spotify accurately.
User Behavior Analysis:

Investigate how user behavior attributes, such as age, gender, and usage period, impact song choices on the platform.
Model Evaluation:

Identify and compare the most effective predictive models for song popularity, assessing their accuracy and AUC.
Insights and Visualizations:

Provide valuable insights into user behavior and preferences on Spotify through visualizations and data-driven analysis.
